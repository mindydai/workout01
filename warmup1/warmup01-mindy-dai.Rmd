Warm-Up 01 - R Markdown Syntax
Stat 133, Fall 2018, Prof. Sanchez
Due date: Sep-04 (before midnight)

Game of Thrones
Figure 1: tyrion-table
 Visit Game of Thrones Wiki (http://gameofthrones.wikia.com) and choose one of the charac- ters (e.g. Tyrion Lannister).
Use markdown syntax to write the following about the character you chose:
• Include one of the character’s quote using a markdown blockquote.
• Include an image of the character.
• Use a markdown table with two columns to include things like status, date of birth,
origin, allegiance, etc (see screen-shot above).

Cooking Recipe
Visit Smitten Kitchen (https://smittenkitchen.com) and choose one recipe (e.g. root vegetable gratin). Write about the recipe using Markdown syntax:
• Use an unordered list (of bullets) to list the ingredients.
• Use another unordered list to list any “special” kitchen tools that are needed. • Describe the steps of the recipe.
• Include an image to show the appearance of the meal.
• Is there a special season of the year for it?
• Are there variations of the recipe? Using other ingredients?

Ingredients\
• 8 ounces dried spaghetti or tonnarelli\
• 4 ounces aged pecorino romano, finely grated\
• A lot of freshly ground black pepper\

Special Kitchen Tools\
• A Pot\
• A Colander\
• A Large Bowl\

There is no special season for it.

You can use a different type of pasta such as "spaghetti alla chittara" to get a different texture. 


Quadratic Equation
Visit the wikipedia page for the quadratic equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Quadratic_equation

Write the general form of a quadratic equation, and provide a brief description for it:
$ax^2 +bx+c=0$

Write the formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation:
$x = \frac{−b± \sqrt{b^2−4ac}}{2a}$

Also, write the derivation of the solution:\
$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$\
$4a^2x^2 + 4abx + 4ac = 0$\
$4a^2x^2 + 4abx = -4ac$\
$(2ax + b)^2 = b^2 - 4ac$\
$2ax + b = ±\sqrt{b^2−4ac}$\
$2ax = -b ±\sqrt{b^2−4ac}$\
$x = \frac{−b± \sqrt{b^2−4ac}}{2a}$


Comments and Reflections
Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. Here are some questions that you can start with to provide comments on your HW.


• What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?

Yes, I feel fairly positively about it as I think it's relatively straightforward. 

• If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing
this assignment?

This question does not apply to me.
