Warm-Up 01 - R Markdown Syntax Stat 133, Fall 2018, Prof. Sanchez Due date: Sep-04 (before midnight)

Game of Thrones Figure 1: tyrion-table Visit Game of Thrones Wiki (<http://gameofthrones.wikia.com>) and choose one of the charac- ters (e.g. Tyrion Lannister). Use markdown syntax to write the following about the character you chose: • Include one of the character’s quote using a markdown blockquote. • Include an image of the character. • Use a markdown table with two columns to include things like status, date of birth, origin, allegiance, etc (see screen-shot above). 2

> "I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark, I will always be a Stark."

Cooking Recipe Visit Smitten Kitchen (<https://smittenkitchen.com>) and choose one recipe (e.g. root vegetable gratin). Write about the recipe using Markdown syntax: • Use an unordered list (of bullets) to list the ingredients. • Use another unordered list to list any “special” kitchen tools that are needed. • Describe the steps of the recipe. • Include an image to show the appearance of the meal. • Is there a special season of the year for it? • Are there variations of the recipe? Using other ingredients?

Ingredients
• 8 ounces dried spaghetti or tonnarelli
• 4 ounces aged pecorino romano, finely grated
• A lot of freshly ground black pepper
Special Kitchen Tools
• A Pot
• A Colander
• A Large Bowl

There is no special season for it.

You can use a different type of pasta such as "spaghetti alla chittara" to get a different texture.

Quadratic Equation Visit the wikipedia page for the quadratic equation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/> Quadratic\_equation

Write the general form of a quadratic equation, and provide a brief description for it: *a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0

Write the formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation: $x = \\frac{−b± \\sqrt{b^2−4ac}}{2a}$

Also, write the derivation of the solution:
*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* + 4*a**c* = 0
4*a*<sup>2</sup>*x*<sup>2</sup> + 4*a**b**x* = −4*a**c*
(2*a**x* + *b*)<sup>2</sup> = *b*<sup>2</sup> − 4*a**c*
$2ax + b = ±\\sqrt{b^2−4ac}$
$2ax = -b ±\\sqrt{b^2−4ac}$
$x = \\frac{−b± \\sqrt{b^2−4ac}}{2a}$

Comments and Reflections Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. Here are some questions that you can start with to provide comments on your HW.

• What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?

There wasn't anything that I thought I was hard despite seeing them in class.

• What was easy(-ish) even though we haven’t done it in class?

The markdown practice was easy(-ish) even though we haven't really done anything yet.

• Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?

Yes, I feel fairly positively about it as I think it's relatively straightforward.

• If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing this assignment?

This question does not apply to me.

• Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?

No one helped me with assignment.

• How much time did it take to complete this HW?

It took abut 45 minutes to complete this homework.

• What was the most time consuming part?

The LaTeX part was the most time consuming.
